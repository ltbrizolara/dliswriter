.. _Viewer issues:

Viewer compatibility issues
===========================

The DLIS format is defined by
`the RP66 v1 standard <https://energistics.org/sites/default/files/RP66/V1/Toc/main.html>`_.
This writer package strives to follow the standard as closely as sensible
while providing an easy-to-use interface.
However, it has been noticed that different DLIS viewers impose additional restrictions on the file format,
which may cause issues when opening files produced by this writer - even though the files conform to the standard.
Some of the known issues - and, if applicable, solutions - are described below.
