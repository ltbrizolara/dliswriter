EFLR objects
------------
*Explicitly Formatted Logical Records* are meant for representing metadata according to pre-defined schemes.
More than 20 such schemes are defined (see `Implemented EFLR objects`_).
Each one lists a specific set of attributes.
Some of the EFLRs are required for a DLIS file: *File Header*, *Origin*,
*Frame*, and *Channels*. Others are optional ways of specifying more metadata.
