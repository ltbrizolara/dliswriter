Welcome to `dlis-writer`, possibly the only public Python library for creating DLIS files.

### Example scripts
Scripts in the [examples](./examples) folder illustrate the basic usage of the library.

- [create_synth_dlis.py](./examples/create_synth_dlis.py) shows how to add every kind 
of DLIS object to the file - including Parameters, Equipment, Comments, No-Formats, etc.
It is also shown how multiple frames (in this case, a depth-based and a time-based frame) can be defined.

- [create_dlis_from_data.py](./examples/create_dlis_from_data.py) can be used to make a DLIS file
from any HDF5 data source.

- [create_synth_dlis_variable_data.py](./examples/create_synth_dlis_variable_data.py) allows creating DLIS files
with any number of 2D datasets with a user-defined shape, filled with randomised data. 


Furthermore, scripts contained in the [file_format_converter](./src/dlis_writer/file_format_converter) 
subpackage can be used to create DLIS files from a number of different input data formats 
(including hdf5, csv, and las.)
